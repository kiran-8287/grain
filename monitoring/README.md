# Grain Quality Analyzer — Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

Internal read-only Streamlit dashboard for observing the Grain Quality Analyzer backend.

The dashboard reads structured JSON Lines logs written by the application. It never clears, rotates, truncates, or deletes logs.

## Log Location

- Primary log file: `logs/app.log`
- Rotated files: `logs/app.log.1`, `logs/app.log.2`, etc.
- Log rotation: size-based, 10 MB max, 5 backups (configured in `backend/app/main.py`)

## Startup

Install dashboard dependencies (if not already installed):

    pip install streamlit pandas plotly

Start the dashboard:

    C:\Python314\python.exe -m streamlit run monitoring/app.py

> **Note:** On this machine, the `streamlit` command may resolve to a Python 3.12
> installation with an incompatible `starlette` version. Using the Python 3.14
> module invocation above avoids that issue.

Environment variables:
- `GRAIN_LOG_DIR` — optional override for the log directory (default: `logs/`)

## Dashboard Tabs

### Overview
Top-level health state and key metrics:
- Total API Requests
- Success Rate
- Failed Requests
- Average Response Time
- P95 Response Time
- Peak / Current Concurrency
- Peak Process RSS Memory
- Last Log Event

Health states:
- GREEN = Healthy
- YELLOW = Warning (elevated error rate > 10%)
- RED = Critical (stale logs or no activity)

### System Health
- Request activity over time (per minute)
- Process RSS Memory (current / average / peak)
- Log freshness indicator
- Backend activity state

### API Performance
Per-endpoint statistics:
- route
- request_count
- success_count / failure_count
- success_rate
- avg / p50 / p95 / max duration_ms

Charts:
- Average vs P95 vs Maximum latency
- Highest volume endpoints
- Highest failure endpoints

### Analysis Performance
Grain Quality Analyzer specific metrics:
- total / successful / failed analyses
- avg / p50 / p95 / max analysis duration

Stage timing (average):
- image decode
- rice gate
- segmentation
- geometry
- broken classification
- annotation

### Analysis History
Recent analysis jobs table:
- timestamp (IST)
- job_id
- request_id
- status
- processing_time_ms
- rice_detected
- grain_count / whole_count / broken_count / undetermined_count
- reference_source
- failed_stage

Filterable by status and date.

### Errors & Failures
- total errors
- error rate
- failed API requests
- failed analyses

Charts:
- failures by endpoint
- failures by pipeline stage
- failures over time

Recent errors table with all fields visible.

### Live Log View
Recent structured log events with filters:
- event
- stage
- job_id
- request_id
- errors only
- endpoint / route

Newest first, limited to last 500 matching events for performance.

## Refresh

- Refresh Now button (re-reads logs)
- Auto-refresh: Off (use Refresh Now manually)
- Cached for 5 seconds by Streamlit

**Refresh never modifies, deletes, rotates, or truncates logs.**

## Data Retention

- Logs are persistent historical records
- Dashboard is read-only
- Application-side rotation controls disk growth
- No destructive admin controls

## Log Format

Structured JSON Lines. Each line is a JSON object.

Minimum fields for request records:
- timestamp
- event (request_started / request_finished / request_failed)
- request_id
- method
- path / route
- status_code
- ok
- duration_ms
- error_type / error_message (on failure)

Minimum fields for analysis records:
- timestamp
- event (analysis_started / analysis_completed / analysis_failed)
- job_id
- request_id (linked)
- status
- total_processing_ms
- failed_stage / error_type / error_message (on failure)

Stage timing records:
- stage-specific fields (duration_ms, grain_count, etc.)

System records (when available):
- process_id
- rss_mb

## Request vs Analysis Duration

- **Request duration**: HTTP request lifecycle (serialization, network, etc.)
- **Analysis duration**: actual image processing pipeline time

These are not identical. The dashboard shows both separately.

## Timezone

Timestamps stored internally in UTC. Displayed in IST (UTC+5:30).

## Security

The dashboard and logger never log:
- uploaded image bytes
- base64 image data
- secrets / passwords
- .env contents
- authorization headers

## Testing

Unit tests for the log parser and dashboard metrics:

    pytest tests/test_monitoring.py -v

Test fixture (synthetic data, clearly labeled):
- `tests/fixtures/monitoring_sample.log`

## Known Limitations

- This is an internal monitoring dashboard built on persistent structured logs
- Not a centralized observability platform
- Memory metrics require explicit `rss_mb` / `process_id` fields in log records
- Rotated log discovery follows `app.log*` naming convention
