"""
Standards comparison engine.

Compares image-derived measurements against configured historical/reference
raw rice limits without asserting current-season verification.

Creates TWO separate outputs:
A. Image-based standard screening (parameter-by-parameter comparison)
B. Formal official grade status (honest about limitations)

Does NOT invent a formal Government of India grade from image features.
